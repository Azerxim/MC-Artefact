Hi there, dataminer!

If you're reading this, you've stumbled across a feature I WANTED to implement,
but couldn't because of Optifine's limited development! Unfortunately, changing
the in-world appearance of a horse's armor isn't possible in Optifine as of right
now. However, if this ever changes and sp64x implements this feature that's been
marked as "todo" on the Optifine issue tracker since 2017, you can brag and say
that you knew this was coming for however long!

Here's to hoping!

Yours,
Dee <3
